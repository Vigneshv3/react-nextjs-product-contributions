This repository documents my product-focused work in the React and Next.js open-source ecosystem.

The artifacts here are a retrospective consolidation of work carried out between **July 2025 – December 2025**, during which I focused on:
- Developer experience (DX)
- Onboarding and documentation clarity
- Feature discoverability
- Reducing adoption friction for new developers.

While this repository was organized later, the work reflects real problem analysis, product thinking, and community-driven insights derived from GitHub issues, discussions, and RFCs.
