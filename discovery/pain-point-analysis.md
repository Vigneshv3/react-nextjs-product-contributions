# Pain Point Analysis — Next.js Onboarding

## Repeated Pain Points Observed
- Misuse of the `use client` directive
- Over-fetching data on the client
- Incorrect assumptions carried over from React-only apps
- Difficulty reasoning about server-first rendering

## Root Causes
- Documentation emphasizes syntax over intent
- Lack of explicit decision guidance
- Examples provided without explaining trade-offs

## Insight
Improving developer experience requires **clarifying decisions**, not adding more examples.
