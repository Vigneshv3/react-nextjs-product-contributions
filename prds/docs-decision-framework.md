# PRD: Decision-Based Documentation Framework

## Objective
Help developers make correct architectural decisions quickly by restructuring documentation around decision-making rather than feature description.

## Problem Statement
Developers often understand available features but struggle to decide when to use each option correctly.

## Target Users
- Developers new to Next.js
- Developers migrating existing applications

## Proposed Framework
- Decision trees (If X, then Y)
- Explicit trade-off explanations
- Anti-pattern examples

## Success Criteria
- Reduced repeated questions in community forums
- Improved correctness of default implementations

## Non-Goals
- No changes to underlying framework behavior

## Risks
- Documentation may become verbose
- Requires ongoing alignment with framework evolution
