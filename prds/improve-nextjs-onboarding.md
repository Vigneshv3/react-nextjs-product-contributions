# PRD: Improve Next.js App Router Onboarding

## Objective
Reduce onboarding friction for developers adopting the Next.js App Router by improving conceptual clarity and decision-making guidance.

## Problem Statement
Current documentation explains App Router features but lacks guidance on when and why to use them, leading to confusion and incorrect implementations.

## Target Users
- New Next.js developers
- React developers migrating from Pages Router

## User Needs
- Clear mental models for server-first rendering
- Guidance on component placement decisions
- Confidence during initial setup

## Proposed Solution
- Introduce a dedicated App Router onboarding guide
- Add decision-based documentation sections
- Highlight common mistakes and anti-patterns

## Non-Goals
- No new framework features
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

## Constraints
- Must align with existing framework principles
- Must not oversimplify architectural concepts

## Risks
- Oversimplification may mislead advanced users
- Increased documentation maintenance overhead
