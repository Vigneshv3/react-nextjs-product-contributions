# Success Metrics — Developer Experience Improvements

This document outlines qualitative and proxy metrics used to evaluate improvements in developer experience and onboarding clarity.

## Primary Metrics
- Reduction in repeated onboarding-related GitHub issues
- Fewer questions related to Server vs Client Component confusion
- Improved clarity in community discussions

## Secondary Signals
- Positive feedback in GitHub discussions
- Faster time-to-first-correct-implementation (qualitative)
- Reduced need for maintainer clarification

## Measurement Approach
Given the open-source nature of the project, success is primarily evaluated through qualitative signals and community feedback rather than direct telemetry.

## Limitations
- Lack of direct usage analytics
- Reliance on community-reported signals
